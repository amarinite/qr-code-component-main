## My process

First tiny project! This was simple but still insightful, as my first challenge. 

The main thing I had to think about with this card was what method to use to center things. For the card component itself, I created a container and went with the margin auto on the left and rigth sides.

For the image and text elements I started by using flexbox. This gave me the result I wanted, but on a second pass I thought it was a bit of an overkill and ended up refactoring using percentages, since this is a small fixed width component and it won't create problems with smaller devices. 

I'm realizing I tend to overthink problems... I guess more practice will help me with that. But also, I guess that's what refactoring is for, so maybe it's not that big of a deal.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Just because you can use flexbox doesn't mean that you should, probably.

### Continued development

Next stop, another pure HTML and CSS component that helps me get some practice with flexbox and css grid, since I'm still not really confident with layouts.
